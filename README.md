Development of a Roundabout using JaCaMo

# JaCaMo
JaCaMo is a framework for Multi-Agent Programming that combines three separate technologies, each of them being well-known on its own and developed for a number of years so they are fairly robust and fully-fledged.

JaCaMo is a combination of:

Jason – for programming autonomous agents
Cartago – for programming environment artifacts
Moise – for programming multi-agent organisations

thus covering all levels of abstractions that are required for the development of sophisticated multi-agent systems.

The JaCaMo platform being a combination of three platforms, the JaCaMo platform is distributed under the licences of each platform, i.e. available open source and under GNU LGPL.

The JaCaMo website: http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/ .
